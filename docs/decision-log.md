# CreativeSignal — Decision Log

## Entry #1 — Vertical: Skincare (W0.2)

**Decision:** Confirmed skincare as the vertical, per the default in `implementation.md` §0.1.

**Rationale:** Densest coverage in the Meta Ad Library among the three candidates considered (skincare, fitness apparel, meal-kit); both Tier-2 ad-copy datasets contain beauty/skincare rows; skincare's regulated efficacy claims ("clinically proven," "reduces wrinkles") make the Reviewer agent genuinely load-bearing rather than decorative — a real policy-risk surface exists to catch.

**Alternatives considered:** Fitness apparel, meal-kit — both were viable per the strategy doc's own framing (the vertical is a filter value and curation choice, not an architectural one), but skincare's regulatory density gives the Reviewer agent a sharper demo story.

**Status:** Locked. Nothing downstream changes except dataset filters and example queries if revisited.

## Entry #2 — Stretch goal: `visual_direction` field on Concept (not scheduled)

**Idea:** Add a written "visual direction" field to each generated Concept — composition, mood, color palette, product placement, referencing patterns from retrieved evidence. A text prompt/brief a human could hand to a designer or image-gen tool, not an actual generated image.

**Why this version, not actual image generation:** Text-only stays inside existing constraints — no new vendor key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` remains the only secret), no new dependency, same Sonnet call that already generates the concept. Actual image generation would require a second vendor API key, directly violating the DECIDED "no extra vendor API keys" rule, and adds a content-moderation/cost/quality failure surface that cuts against "explainability beats sophistication."

**Where it fits the plan:** "Image drafts" is already named in the cut order (fine-tune → A2A → image drafts → MCP) as the third thing cut if time runs short — this entry just defines what that stretch item would concretely mean if pursued, following the same kill-switch logic already used for fine-tuning (only enters if Weeks 1–4 bank surplus, exits after a capped time regardless).

**Status:** Not scheduled. Revisit at the W4.2 walkthrough (Concept schema / "what must the evidence contain") — decide there whether to add `visual_direction: str` or defer for good, based on actual time banked by Week 4.
